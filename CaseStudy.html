          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">Further investigation revealed that the employee was running a
            software training institute on the other
            side. That Employee assigned their work to students for practical experience and even passed off these
            projects as their own. </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">This case highlights the difficulties that can arise when it comes
            to managing remote employees. While
            virtual interviews and work-from-home arrangements can make it easier for them to do these frauds and manage
            work with someone and also hide real authentication of them to provide fake employment documentation so that
            it's harder to identify unethical or off-target employees. Employers must be vigilant in verifying the
            credentials of job
            candidates and keep an eye on the
            performance of their remote workers. </p>
