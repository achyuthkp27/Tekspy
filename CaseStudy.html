            <p>Nowadays, many companies are providing remote work to continue business operations during the pandemic.
              While working from home has its benefits, it also presents new challenges for employers, as it can be
              difficult to verify the authenticity of job seekers and employees. </p>
            <p>This was the case for a reputed organization that received one employee who had recently joined the
              company. The team leader noticed that the employee was busy with some other calls, not involving work
              much, and take more than the targeted time to complete tasks with excuses, all of these things lead the
              company to suspect that something was amiss. </p>
          </div>

        </div>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="text-center text-lg-start">
          <p class="mt-5" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">The company wants to dig deeper into his identity for
            verifying the employee in all possible
            ways, for that, they believe in our company efficiently and approach us. First, we verified his address and
            previous employment. We got to know that the employee was working for several other companies some of the
            companies offered permanent work-from-home. </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">Further investigation revealed that the employee was running a
            software training institute on the other
            side. That Employee assigned their work to students for practical experience and even passed off these
            projects as their own. </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">This case highlights the difficulties that can arise when it comes
            to managing remote employees. While
            virtual interviews and work-from-home arrangements can make it easier for them to do these frauds and manage
            work with someone and also hide real authentication of them to provide fake employment documentation so that
            it's harder to identify unethical or off-target employees. Employers must be vigilant in verifying the
            credentials of job
            candidates and keep an eye on the
            performance of their remote workers. </p>

                employment through a streamlined verification team. For that purpose recently one small-scale company
                believes us and tie up for background verification of employees. They initiate employment verification
                for the candidate in question. However, when we tried to reach out to the candidate's previous company,
                we discovered that they were no longer physically located at the address listed on their previous
                payslip of the candidate. Despite this, we communicated with the company through emails, and calls and
                they promptly provided us with the necessary information to verify the candidate's employment. </p>

              enabled by a nexus between crooked HR staff and more than willing potential recruits, who are prone to use
